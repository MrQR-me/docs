## Introduction
{: .text-purple-000 }

**MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } provides a simple, low-cost, secure, globally accessible item management platform. Site Owners can create their own Forms, assign those Forms to any Item, and allow other Users to access information and submit completed Forms.

Site costs are minimal and there are no User costs associated with any Site. Users are completely independent and have their own User accounts.

Any User can create their own **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Sites and request access to any Item on any **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Site using the unique **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Code created on the **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } platform.

Anyone including employers, employees, contractors, subcontractors, and members of the public can register for a Free User Account.

Free User Accounts can be upgraded to a Pro User Account that includes a full User profile with training and equipment records that can be used to automate the submission of any **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Form. 

A fully functional Personal Site, only accessible to the **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } account holder, is also included with the Pro User Account, enabling them to create multiple personal Registers to manage their Items and assign multiple **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Form templates.

Users can subscribe to monthly **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Site Owner licences to create multiple Registers of Items, then assign multiple Forms to each Item containing information, images, questionnaires, and checklists.  All of these are accessible to any **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } registered User once the **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Site Owner has approved their requested access.

Site Owners can also invite other **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Users to help manage and build their **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Sites.

The **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Form Builder addon is included with an active MrQR Site Owner license. **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Form Templates can be duplicated and customised. New **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Forms can also be created.

With the **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } platform you can manage almost anything including:
* Building site inductions
* Training records
* Permits to work or enter restricted locations
* Regular safety checks of plant and equipment (*MEWPs, Ladders, Electrical Distribution or Appliances, Vehicles etc*)
* Manage and share collections
* Distribute product O&M Manuals
* Vehicle checklists and service history
* Expense tracking
* Registration & sign-ups
* Maintenance inspections of plant and equipment

Each Item has its own unique **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Code Sticker Image, which can be printed and attached to whatever you want. Scanning this allows secure access to the information and Forms assigned to that Item.

Form submissions can be viewed individually or exported together in .csv format to be used in your preferred spreadsheet software.
