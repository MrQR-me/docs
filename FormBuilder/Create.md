Select the <button class="button button1">NEW FORM</button> button.

Select the <button class="button button1">SAVE</button> button once you have entered the desired Form name in the 'new Form name' box or select the <button class="button button2">CANCEL</button> button to cancel any changes.

## Naming Your Form
{: .text-purple-000 }

You can give your Form any name you like. Forms are universal, so they can be assigned to any Item and duplicated across all of your Sites. With this in mind, it's worth considering how you name your Forms.

If you have a single Site and only a few Forms, a simple name describing what your Form does should be suitable.

However, if you have multiple Sites with many Forms, it's a good idea to use names that include the Site used and the version of the Form, like the example below:

**Site Name - Form Name - Version**
{: .text-center}

`Site 1 - Ladder Inspection - V1.0`
{: .text-center}

## Form Settings
{: .text-purple-000 }

Your new Form is now created and will open in the `Form Settings` panel.

You can <button class="button button2">VIEW ITEMS</button> your form has been assigned to, <button class="button button2">EDIT</button> and change the Form name, or <button class="button button1">PUBLISH</button> your Form to confirm all changes.

## Items Assigned to Your Form
{: .text-purple-000 }

By selecting the <button class="button button2">VIEW ITEMS</button> button, all Items that your Form is assigned to will be displayed.

If Items are associated with your Form, you will have the option to view the item or **Remove**{: .text-red-000 } the Form from the Item. Select the <button class="button button2">CLOSE</button> button to return to the Form settings panel.

## Editing the Name & Type of Form
{: .text-purple-000 }

Select the <button class="button button1">SAVE</button> button once you have entered the desired Form name in the 'new Form name' box or select the <button class="button button2">CANCEL</button> button to cancel any changes.

Tick the <img width="15" alt="image" src="https://docs.mrqr.me/assets/images/Forms/MrQR_Empty_Box.png"> Global box to make the Form a Global Form that can be duplicated by any **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } User.

## Adding a New Section
{: .text-purple-000 }

You can start building your Form by adding [sections](https://docs.mrqr.me/FormBuilder/Section) followed by [content](https://docs.mrqr.me/FormBuilder/Content) and/or [inputs](https://docs.mrqr.me/FormBuilder/Data_Inputs).

## Publishing Your Form
{: .text-purple-000 }

Before a Form becomes active it must be published. To secure the Form submissions on the **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } platform, each time you alter your Form, a new version is created. Although you will only see the latest version, any data previously entered on a Form will be associated with the Form version it was submitted on.
