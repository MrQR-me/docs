## preserving Form Integrity
{: .text-purple-000 }

Please Note:

As forms to be used accros  different site and assigned tp multiple assets by different users the integrity of the form must ge protected.

this us achieved by creating a hieracy of forms i.e.

the original form created on the original site (site A)

if duplicated on  (site A) a new form is created with full Editable access.

if duplicated to another site (Site B) the original content is preserved and can only be alterd or removed from site A.

New content & inputs can be edited to original sections however these will be locked on the form on site B and fully editable on the form in site A.

New Sections, Content and inputs can be added, edited and removed as normal on the form on site B and not added to the original form on Site A.

If the form is diplicated again on site B a new form is created with full Editable access.
