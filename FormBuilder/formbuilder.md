## Preserving Form Integrity
{: .text-purple-000 }

**Please Note:**

As forms can be used accross different sites and assigned to multiple assets by different users, the integrity of the form is protected, this is achieved by creating a hieracy of forms i.e.

* The original form created on the original site (site **A**)
  
* If duplicated on site **A** a new form is created and fully Editable.
  
* If duplicated to another site (Site **B**) the original content is preserved and cannot  be edited. (this can be useful if you are creating a template to use accross your sites)

* Additional sections, content and inputs added to the original form in site **A** will not be added to the duplicated form in site **B**
  
* New content & inputs can be added to original sections on the duplicated form on site **B** however they cannot  be edited or removed and will not be added to the original gorm in site **A**.
  
* New Sections, Content and inputs can be added, edited and removed as normal on the duplicated form on site **B** and will not added to the original form on Site **A**.
  
* If the form is duplicated again on site **B** a new form is created and is fully Editable.

The above helps preserve the integity of the form and allows forms to be customised to suite individual sites.

**REMEBER TO CHANGE THE NAMES OF YOUR FORMS**

when creating forms for use with multiple users it should be considered to add a Notes section including the text
