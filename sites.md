# **SITES**
{: .text-purple-000 }
{: .no_toc }

A Personal Site is included with a **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } Pro User Account. The Registers and Items created in a Personal Site can only be viewed by the Personal Site Owner. When additional Site Licences are purchased, Registers and Items can be managed and shared with any **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } registered users once permission is granted. **MrQR**{: .text-purple-000 } registered users can also be invited to help manage additional sites.
